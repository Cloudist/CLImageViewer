## How To Use?

Usage is simple. Here's what your simplest implementation might look like:   

```objc
    - (void)onSomeImageClicked:(id)sender {
        NSMutableArray* imageUrls = [NSMutableArray new];
        NSMutableArray* placeHoldeImages = [NSMutableArray new];
        NSMutableArray* referenceRects = [NSMutableArray new];
        NSUInteger imageIndex = 0;
        UIView* referenceView = nil;
        
        //configure your imageUrls, placeHoldeImages, referenceRects, imageIndex and referenceView
        //...
        
        CLImageViewer* imagesViewer = [CLImageViewer new];
        CLImageInfo* imagesInfo = [CLImageInfo new];
        imagesInfo.imageURLs = imageUrls;
        imagesInfo.placeholderImages = placeHoldeImages;
        imagesInfo.referenceView = referenceView;
        imagesInfo.referenceRects = referenceRects;
        imagesInfo.startImageIndex = imageIndex;
        
        imagesViewer.imageInfo = imagesInfo;
        imagesViewer.fromController = weakSelf;
        [imagesViewer showImageViewFromOriginPosition];
	}
```

## How to Installï¼Ÿ

There are two ways to use CLImageViewer in your project:  

- using Cocoapods, `pod 'CLImageViewer'`  
- copying all the files into your project  

## Tips

- **Just Local Images:**   
	If you don't have the web image already, just set the `placeholderImages` property when setting up the `CLImageInfo` instance, do not set the `imageURLs` property.  

- **Auto Sroll To Original Location:**  
	In some cases, the original location of the image you are watching is out of the screen.   

	This situation, you can set `needSrollToOrigin` property to `YES` when setting up the `CLImageInfo` instance. At the same time the `referenceRects` property should be add just one element which value is from the first opened image.  

	After this, when you single tap any image you are watching, the images list will auto scroll to the image which you first opened, then back to it's original location.
